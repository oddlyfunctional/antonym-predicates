= Antonym Predicates

Generate antonym predicates methods for each regular predicate of a class or instance. If the method's name is in the dictionary, then the antonym is used. Otherwise, the form is "not_#{method_name}"


== Usage

The only thing that you need to configure is the dictionary. Include any antonyms that you want to use.

    require 'antonym_predicates'
    AntonymPredicates.antonyms = {
        "equal"         => "different",
        "is_a"          => "isnt_a",
        "respond_to"    => "doesnt_respond_to"
    }

Then you can generate antonym methods doing the following:

    AntonymPredicates.generate_antonyms String

You can also pass a list to the +generate_antonyms+ method.

    AntonymPredicates.generate_antonyms String, Integer
